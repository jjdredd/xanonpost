To enable the API, copy and paste these lines into the bitmessagesettings section of the keys.dat file (the values "username" and "password" are merely examples):

apienabled = true
apiport = 8442
apiinterface = 127.0.0.1
apiusername = chelsea 
apipassword = YourSuperPassw6rd-ChangeThIs-022w3eksssoQAWfasddswwWIU

Additionally, you may optionally include an additional entry which will specify a program which Bitmessage will run when certain events occur.

apinotifypath = c:\\example\\example.exe

One of these arguments will be passed to your program: startingUp, newMessage, newBroadcast. Be sure your program doesn't crash when given newer arguments introduced in the future as this list will likely expand.
